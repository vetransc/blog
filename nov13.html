    Honestly I never know what to do for these, but it is currently 3 in the morning and I need something. So i'm gonna
    look into some cool html tricks because I didnt do a whole lot of that on the earlier part of the semester.

    There is a map element that lets the user click on different parts of images to get a closer look.
    <div>
        <img src="Images/labs.jpg" width="145" height="126" alt="Labradors" usemap="#labmap">

        <map name="labmap">
            <area shape="circle" coords="80,58,10" href="Images/glab.jpg" alt="Sun">
            <area shape="circle" coords="50,58,10" href="Images/brlab.jpg" alt="Mercury">
            <area shape="circle" coords="110,58,10" href="Images/bllab.jpg" alt="Venus">
        </map>
    </div>
    Honestly the biggest issue with the entire map was figuring out the coordinates
    
    Something else cool that will probably help me with my projects is apparently they have math tags. I can do pretty fractions and stuff

    <math>
        <mfrac>
            <mi>a</mi>
            <mi>b</mi>
        </mfrac>
    </math>
