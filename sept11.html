        <p id="blog">So this week I looked into how to make a website form for creating an accounts.
            I also looked into how to get and handle the information once it is submitted, but that seems to require
            database stuff.
            I worked on combining this  with what I have learned in class to make
            a pretty looking, accesible form.
            It took a little while to figure out how to correctly center the content on the page.
            I ended up having to set both the left and right margin to auto. I also played around with the contents of
            the form.
            In order to keep everything off the same line I made them block elements. Then I had to center them so that
            the fill out parts
            weren't just sitting to the far left of the form. I also did just a little bit of javascript to make a popup
            window work for my sign in link. While my Terms and Privacy just opens in a new tab.
