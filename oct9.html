    <p>This week I'm going to take the game that I started last week and add more functionality to it. I am going to add
        controls, obstacles, and score.
    </p>

    <p>
        So starting with adding in controls, I used a grid display to format the way the controls look in relation to
        each other. I also changed the speed and the movement.
        When I added in an obstacle I had to create a new component because my pieces are circles but I want my
        obstacles to be rectangles. The other thing I changed is becasue they aren't created in the same compnent I
        passed the height and width and postition of the obstacle directly by adding more inputs into the function and then I changed it back.
        The score just keeps track of and displays the frame number.
