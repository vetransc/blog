   <p> This week I looked into video and audio content. 
    I thought about websites and wondered how they made music play automatically when you went to them.
    It actually looks fairly simple, you just use that tags, however we used to not be able to do it straight in the html.
    We had to use things like flash. 
    But I think it is interesting as audio is used a lot in browser based games.
    If it is used subtly it can be a great asset to a web page.
    Because I am loading the videos through youtube, I am using iframe.
   </p>
   <p> It is very important that when you are doing this with audio and video that you include controls on your webpage to stop, start, pause, and control the volume.
       We want our page to be accesible to as many people as possible. For example people with epilepsy. 
       If you have a video with lots of flashing lights and such, it can trigger a seizure. 
       If there is no way to stop the video then the page is not accesible to people with epilepsy.
