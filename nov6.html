    <p>This week I'm going to continuethe game that I started several weeks ago and add more stuff to it.
        I am going to add sound which is turning into a giant pain.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I added sound so that when the ball hit an obstacle it would make a noise... it took forever to find an mp3
        to download, and it is not working becasue of reasons - Autoplay is only allowed when approved by the user, the
        site is activated by the user, or media is muted. nov6.js:159:17
        Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play method is not allowed by the user agent or the platform in the
        current context, possibly because the user denied permission. And now it's working for some reason. So it was
        wokring but then I tried to put in a stop on a timeout so that it didn't play indefinitly and then it broke
        again for the above reason. That didn't work I can get it to stop after one sound it just keep looping and everytime i try to use mySound.stop() it just doesn't play.
