    <p>Cascading style sheets are really cool. 
        Theres lots of different ways to do the same thing.
    </p>
    <div>
    <p>I can do this with just div</p>
    </div>
    <p class="ex2"> I can also do this with a just class tag</p>
    <p id="ex3">  or just an id tag</p>
    The biggest reasons for the difference is how specific you need to be.
    div is good if your working with a chunk of things in one spot, 
    or need to section something of from everything else. 
    Span is good for inline modifications.
    id is used when you have one thing and one thing only.
    class is best when you have multiple things throughout the sheet that
    you want styled the same.
    
    <p>Right now I can't get it to work and it makes me sad, very sad. 
        If you look above you will see I did in fact make it work. 
        There was an s at the end of <span class="emphasis">"stylesheet"</span>
    that was casuing it to break and make me sad.</p>
