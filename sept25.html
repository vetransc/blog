    <p>This week i'm looking into making a tabbed ppages on one page.
        I am doing this beacuse it is currently 10 o'clock
        on a thursday night and I cannot think of anything else to do.
        This will include html, css, and javascript to make it work properly.
    </p>
    <p>I followed the tutorial off of w3school and it is not working and I do not know why.</p>
