<body onload="startGame()">
    <p>So originally I was going to look at REACT this week.
        I was looking into how to create little games, unfortunately I couln't figure out how to host it on the blog.
        Therefore this week I am looking at how to create little games using only html, and js.
    </p>
    <p>I will use the canvas element and javascript to actually draw the elements. So the canvas bit is like the
        background
        and container. At first I couldn't get it to show then I saw that i needed to put
        onload="startGame()" inside the body tag. I am going to stop here for this weeks blog. I've looked in how to use
        and set up the canvas component, how to add and change things about components in canvas, and how to make it
        move using javascript. I can make it leave a trail by not clearing the canvas area when the circle moves. I
        could also make the circle move in different direction by messing with just the y or changing both x and y.
